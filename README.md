A program in C that determines the winner of a short Scrabble-like game. 
The program should prompt for input twice: once for “Player 1” to input their word and once for “Player 2” to input their word. 
Then, depending on which player scores the most points, the program should either print “Player 1 wins!”, “Player 2 wins!”, or “Tie!” (in the event the two players score equal points).
